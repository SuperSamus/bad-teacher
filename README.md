# Bad teacher
This is my first program and the first time using Github, I'm doing it to practise. Do whatever you want with it. If I'm doing something wrong with the code I would be happy if you report it. :)
# About the program
During school, teachers sometimes call a random student in order to do something, like interrogating him (at least in my country (Italy)). Some teachers however use a iniquitous method: they open a random page on a book and they add up the digits of the page (ex.: page 376: 3+7+6=16). Then they call they call the student indexed with this number (16 in this case) in the school register (the students are sorted alphabetically, surnames first).
This method to call a student is terrible, in a book of 400 pages the first student can be called with three pages (1, 10 and 100), while the tenth student has 36 pages that can call him.
With this Python program you'll be able to calculate the probability of each student to be called: just type the number of studnets and the number of the pages and you'll know all the probabilities of each student, including all the pages that can call them. So you can show your teacher that she's so been horribly wrong, so that she'll migrate to the good ol' RNG.
I'm also planning a UI, graphs... Of course all of this has yet to come.
